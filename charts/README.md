# Helm Chart
Helm chart called 'kubeview' is provided in the [charts](./charts) directory to help deploy and install KubeView into your cluster. The chart is also available in packaged form, [in the releases section](https://github.com/pstark-code/kubeview/releases)

Use the supplied sample `example-values.yaml` file (copy it to a new name, e.g. `myvalues.yaml`) to configure how to deploy KubeView. The main choice is if you want to expose the service via an ingress `ingress.enabled: true` or a load-balancer service `ingress.enabled: false`

When using an Ingress additionally configure the DNS hostname and TLS certs if you want to use HTTPS

### Cluster or Namespaced Deployment
the chart supports deployment in a single namespace, set `limitNamespace: true`. In this mode, KubeView will be limited to displaying only the namespace it is deployed into (via the helm `--namespace` flag), and the namespace picker will not be shown in the UI. The ServiceAccount/Role/Binding will be scoped to this namespace too, rather than cluster wide.  

This is passed to the server via the `NAMESPACE_SCOPE` env variable

### Usage
Deploy with the standard Helm install command:
```
cd charts
helm install kubeview ./kubeview -f myvalues.yaml
```
